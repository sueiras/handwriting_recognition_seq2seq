# Seq2seq model to recognize handwritten text

Branch with the code used in the paper.

Code to replicate the results of the paper "Offline continuous handwriting recognition using sequence to sequence neural networks" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231218301371

Software requirements:
- Tensorflow 1.4
- OpenCV 3

The experiments folder include all the code to replicate the results of the best models included in the paper.
To do this, you need:
- Download the IAM and RIMES handwriting databases
- preprocess the IAM and RIMES databases using the notebooks read_IAM_database.ipynb and read_RIMES_database.ipynb
- Execute the training scripts.  


The sample folder include a toy example of the model over a synthetic sequence of MNIST digits executable in google colab.
    - Train a seq2seq architecture over a sequence of digits generated by the MNIST dataset.
    - Same model can be used to the general handwriting text recognition problem
